### Threat modelling

#### Braiterman et al 2020

- Threat modeling allows the user to simulate and imagine what could go wrong in a system
- Threat modeling follows 2 guidelines called Values and principles, values are more about communicating and collaborating with people to find solutions, whilst principles focus more on viewpoints and approaches to fix said issue
- Anyone who is interested in protecting various aspects of safety and security should concern themselves with threat modeling

#### Shostack 2022

- We threat model to anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them
- 4 Questions you need to know about threat modeling: What are we working on, what could go wrong, what are we going to do about it and did we do a good job?
- Developing a document of record can contribute to learning and development on the system a person is currently working on
- Data flow entities are very frequently used for  threat modeling which contains: external entities, data flows, data stores, trust boundaries and processes
- STRIDE helps us to think structured about possible threats

#### OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021

- Threat modeling is usually performed in the early stages of the design phase
- Applying this concept places us into the perspective of the attacker which can help discover security risks early on
- Data flow diagrams are the most common approach for threat modeling
- There can be many challenges for a development team such as the lack of knowledge regarding security, too much time involvement, lack of tools and communication between different parties
- Investment in IT security training is necessary for the development of firm systems

### Infosec scene (Stacc Attack)

- The story starts from the perspective of a person called Jack Rhysider who speaks with someone else called Jarett
- Jarett is someone who stole millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency which is why this episode is called Stacc Attack
- Jack and Jarett talk about cryptocurrencies in general and if they're worth investing into, for example Ethereum or Bitcoin and about the collapse of several markets
- Jarett talks about his mothers death and how he struggled in his life 
- He later then talks about a scheduling software called Clockwork and how he used it to benefit himself
- They talk about Pump.fun which is like a online casino to trade Meme Coins and how addictive it was
- Later in his life, Jarett got hired by Pump.fun and moved to the UK, he was very thrilled
- We also discover that Jarett is on antipsychosis medication because of ADHD, we also hear from him that Pump.fun makes hundreds of millions of dollars per month
- Jarett finds it ridicoulous how Meme Coins can be that popular
- Jarett claims that there are videos of underage girls on certain telegram sites but Jack doesn't ask any further questions, these sites are comparable to 4chan according to Jarett
- The team which works for Pump.fun claims that they have never encountered such issues like Jarett mentioned before, Jack talks about the nasty things he has found out
- Jarett accepts that his actions have consequenses and confronts his past mistakes which is also to blame for the amount of suffering he had to endure
- The more Jack talks with Jarett the more he understands why he is in such a dark place
- Jarett was surprised himself wehn he noticed that his approach worked, it multiplied over time, he says he was able to see what people were doing on the system
- In the end, he pled guilty on the internet, he got caught at 2-3 am in the morning and has to serve a minumum of 7 years in prison
