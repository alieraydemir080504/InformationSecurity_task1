#### Braiterman et al 2020

- Threat modeling follows 2 guidelines called Values and principles, values are more about communicating and collaborating with people to find solutions, whilst principles focus more on viewpoints and approaches to fix said issue
- Anyone who is interested in protecting various aspects of safety and security should concern themselves with threat modeling

#### Shostack 2022

- We threat model to anticipate problems when it's inexpensive to deal with them
- 4 Questions you need to know about threat modeling: What are we working on, what could go wrong, what are we going to do about it and did we do a good job?
- Developing a document of record can contribute to learning and development on the system a person is currently working on
- Data flow entities are very frequently used for  threat modeling which contains: external entities, data flows, data stores, trust boundaries and processes
- STRIDE helps us to think structured about possible threats

#### OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021

- Threat modeling is usually performed in the early stages of the design phase
- Applying this concept places us into the perspective of the attacker which can help discover security risks early on
- Data flow diagrams are the most common approach for threat modeling
- There can be many challenges for a development team such as the lack of knowledge regarding security, too much time involvement, lack of tools and communication between different parties
- Investment in IT security training is necessary for the development of firm systems
